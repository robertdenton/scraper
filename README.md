#Simple scraper#

This is a simple python script that goes out and pulls the top headline on the [CU Independent](http://www.cuindependent.com) website.

I'm going to grow this out into a more useful tool over the next few weeks.

This uses [urllib2](https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html) and [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
